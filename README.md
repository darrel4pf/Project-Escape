**Project Escape**

This project was created as part of Google's Computer Science Summer Institute (CSSI) and served as our formal introduction to web development. Our team of three collaborated to build a web-based game that blends elements of an Impossible Quiz with a Virtual Escape Room, challenging players with tricky riddles and interactive puzzles that lead them through multiple pathways toward victory. Designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the project features complex and engaging riddles, multiple paths to solve the escape room, an intuitive and interactive user experience, and a dark, mysterious theme enhanced by dynamic styling. Through this project, I gained valuable experience in structuring web pages with HTML and CSS, implementing interactive features with JavaScript, collaborating effectively in a team, and crafting logical problem-solving elements within the game. If I were to enhance this project, I would deploy the game online with a custom domain, expand game mechanics with additional levels and animations, improve the user experience with responsive design, and optimize the code for better efficiency and scalability. With this being my first official project, it was an exciting and rewarding experience that fueled my curiosity for software development and intuitive, interactive game design!
